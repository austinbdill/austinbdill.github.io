**About Me**

I'm a recent masters graduate from the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. I was fortunate enough to be advised by Eunsu Kang and Barnabas Poczos. I'm currently working with Barnabas Poczos on monocular depth estimation from aerial images.

**Research Interests**

I'm broadly interested in generative models, deep learning, and learning theory. On the applications side, I'm most interested in natural language processing, computational creativity, and public policy.

**Previously**

Before graduate school, I received my undergraduate degree in computer science from the Georgia Institute of Technology in my hometown of Atlanta, GA.
