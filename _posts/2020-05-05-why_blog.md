### Why?

With the existence of many great machine learning blogs it seems like noise pollution to put another one out there. I decided to make one anyway mostly for my own enjoyment and education. I spent years [tutoring and TAing](/teaching) while attending college and it was the most rewarding work I've ever done. I also came to believe that I never really understood something until I've taught it, so this blog is an opportunity to "teach" anything I really want to understand.

### Planned Posts

Looking forward, there are a few topics I'd like to write about, either because they struck me as especially important during my education, they align with my research interests, or because I haven't found resources that cover them how I would like to see them covered. Here's a short list of some of these topics:

- The LASSO problem
    - Motivation
    - Theoretical guarantees
    - Algorithms for computation
- Deep learning for point clouds
    - Machine learning on sets
    - Topological considerations for generative models
- Connections between GANs, VAEs, and Normalizing Flows
- Essential topics in computer science for ML
- High performance computing
    - GPU programming
    - Parallel and distributed programming
- Practical implementation of hybrid deep learning / graphical model algorithms
